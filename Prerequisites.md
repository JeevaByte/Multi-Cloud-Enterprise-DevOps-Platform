# Prerequisites for Multi-Cloud DevOps Platform Implementation

Before proceeding with implementation, ensure that the following prerequisites are met. These are categorized into Infrastructure, Tools, Access, Security, and Knowledge Requirements.

## 1️⃣ Infrastructure Setup

### 🔹 AWS & Azure Accounts
- Active AWS account with IAM admin access.
- Active Azure subscription with necessary role assignments.

### 🔹 Networking & Connectivity
- AWS VPC & Azure Virtual Network (VNet) setup.
- VPN/Peering or Azure ExpressRoute if hybrid connectivity is needed.
- DNS & Private Link considerations for inter-cloud communication.

### 🔹 Storage & Database Requirements
- AWS S3 & Azure Blob Storage for Terraform remote backend.
- AWS RDS & Azure SQL Server setup for microservices (if required).
- EFS (AWS) or Azure Files for shared persistent storage.

## 2️⃣ Tools & Software Setup

### 🔹 Local Development Setup (Mac/Linux/Windows)
- Install Terraform (latest version).
- Install Ansible.
- Install AWS CLI & Azure CLI (configured with access credentials).
- Install kubectl & Helm for Kubernetes management.
- Install ArgoCD CLI for GitOps deployment.
- Install Istio CLI for service mesh configuration.
- Install Trivy, OWASP ZAP, and Checkov for security scanning.

### 🔹 DevOps Tooling Setup
- GitHub Repository for managing infrastructure & app code.
- ArgoCD installed on Kubernetes clusters.
- GitHub Actions configured for CI/CD pipelines.
- Prometheus & Grafana configured for monitoring.

## 3️⃣ Access & Permissions

### 🔹 Cloud Access & IAM Roles
- AWS IAM Roles & Policies for Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Azure Role Assignments for AKS & storage access.
- Service Accounts for Kubernetes workloads.

### 🔹 Secret Management
- AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault for sensitive credentials.
- HashiCorp Vault (if needed for additional security).

### 🔹 SSH & API Access
- SSH access to Kubernetes worker nodes (if required).
- API keys/tokens for GitHub, ArgoCD, and Istio.

## 4️⃣ Security & Compliance

### 🔹 HIPAA Compliance Requirements
- Encryption in transit & at rest enabled for all services.
- Audit logging & monitoring set up for access tracking.
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enforced in Kubernetes.
- Automated security scans integrated in CI/CD.

### 🔹 Certificate Management
- SSL/TLS certificates for secured endpoints (AWS ACM / Azure Certificates).
- Istio mTLS (mutual TLS) enabled for service-to-service communication.

## 5️⃣ Knowledge & Training Requirements

### 🔹 Essential Knowledge Areas
- Terraform & Ansible (for infrastructure automation).
- Kubernetes concepts (EKS, AKS, Istio, Helm, ArgoCD).
- GitOps workflows & ArgoCD best practices.
- Cloud networking (VPC, Subnets, DNS, Load Balancers, Peering).
- Security best practices (IAM, RBAC, DevSecOps, Compliance).
